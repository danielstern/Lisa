<h1>Lisa</h1>
<h2>Delightfully Object Oriented Simulated Person</h2>
<p>Lisa is designed to be the basis of an intelligent conversation simulator that will ultimately allow NPCs in games to say different things, every time - and mean it!<p>
<p>Lisa has many other uses including teaching people to speak new languages, and simulating staff at kiosks.</p>
<p>Lisa is built with underscore.js!</p>
